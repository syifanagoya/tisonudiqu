He is an extremely dedicated athlete which might be why many of his fans have been wondering if he has a girlfriend. Let's take a look at Olave's relationship status, as well as his performance at the 2022 NFL Scouting Combine.</strong></p><p><strong>Chris Olave</strong> (born June 27, 2000) is a wide receiver for the Ohio State Buckeyes in college football. He played high school football for Mission Hills High School in San Marcos, California. Olave has 35 touchdown receptions in Ohio State history, surpassing David Boston's previous mark of 34.</p><p>Olave was born on June 27, 2000, in California. Later, he joined Mission Hills High School in San Marcos, California, and played high school football there. He had 93 receptions for 1,764 yards and 26 touchdowns throughout his senior season. As a 2017 prospect, he had a four-star rating from 247Sports.com and was ranked as the nation's No. 54 wide receiver. When Olave enrolled in January 2018, he chose Ohio State over UCLA, USC, and Utah.</p><h2>Chris Olave's Girlfriend: Relationship Detail of the NFL First Round Prospect</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2022/03/chris-olave-girlfriend-ohio-2022.jpg alt=chris-olave-girlfriend-ohio-2022 width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Chris Olave shone at the 2022 NFL Combine and fans want to know all the details of the Ohio Star, including his girlfriend.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a></strong></p><p><strong>Chris Olave</strong> is a twenty-one-year-old man. He is an extremely active Instagram user&nbsp;with over 170,000 followers. Having a girlfriend for his age and stature is not something out of the imagination. However, looking at his Instagram, Chris is single and not dating anyone as of 2022. On Instagram, he has never mentioned anyone as his girlfriend. His Instagram hints us that he is a loyal buddy who prioritizes his profession over spending time with his girlfriend or partner.</p><p>Olave posts photographs of his personal life, games, and time with his family on his Instagram. We looked through his social media accounts for clues regarding his love life, but information was sparse. Chris has kept his personal life private, and no information about his girlfriend has been made public. It's possible he might have kept his girlfriend's identity a secret. It appears that the athlete is focusing all of his attention on catching balls on the field.</p><p>There were some tagged photos of the player with few ladies but most appear to be acquaintances. He also does not have any pictures from his prom. There are photos from his graduation, but none of the pictures were with his girlfriend. Again, he may not have one but considering the amazing performance at the 2022 Combine, the player is going in the First Round of the Draft and ladies will be throwing themselves at the soon-to-be millionaire.</p><p>His mother, <strong>LaCausha Olave</strong>, and father, <strong>Raul Olave</strong>, raised him. He is quite close to his mother, and he previously <a href=# rel=noopener>posted</a> a photo of himself and his mother wishing her a happy birthday. He appreciated her hard work and commitment to giving him her all.</p><p>Olave grew up alongside his two older brothers. Both of his brothers are football players. The eldest brother, <strong>Isiah Zeke Olave</strong>, played football at UC Davis, while the other brother, <strong>Josh Olave</strong>, attends Azusa Pacific University. The parents described how stressful it was to drive to three different locations to see their sons play. They do, however, make it to all of their boys' games.</p><p>Chris is a track and field athlete in addition to football. He ran tracks during his stay at Missions Hills High School. In 2018, he committed to play for Ohio State University. In any case, we will inform you as soon as possible if we hear that the athlete has a girlfriend.</p><h2>Chris Olave puts a stunning 40-time at the NFL Scouting Combine 2022</h2><p></p><p>The quarterbacks and pass-catchers took center stage on Thursday during the first night of workouts at the 2022 <a href=#><strong>NFL</strong></a> Scouting Combine. While some wide receivers and tight ends declined to participate in all of the physical tests, those who did impressed evaluators with their speed in the 40-yard dash, quickness in shuttle drills, and explosiveness in the broad and vertical jumps.</p><p><strong>Chris Olave</strong> was the best wide receiver in Thursday's second group of wideouts, and it wasn't even close. Since his arrival at Ohio State, he's been labeled a smooth mover, and he didn't do anything to change that at the combine. Olave collected practically everything sent his way, catching numerous deep and short tosses well away from his frame. His 40-yard dash time of 4.39 seconds was more impressive than his 32-inch vertical and 10-foot broad jump.</p><p>NFL Draft prospect Chris Olave<a href=# rel=noopener> ran</a> the 40-yard sprint and he did it quickly. The Ohio State wide receiver ran a 4.26-second 40-yard sprint in his first attempt (unofficial). Olave's mark of 4.26 seconds would tie him with <strong>Jerome Mathis</strong>and <strong>Dri Archer</strong> for the third-fastest 40-yard sprint finish in NFL Combine history. In 2017, <strong>John Ross III</strong> established a new world record of 4.22 seconds. The unofficial time was later rounded up to 4.39 seconds, much to the irritation of fans.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>Olave had already been projected as a first-round pick before his performance at the NFL Combine, and he's done nothing to undermine his status in Indianapolis. The 6' 3/8" wideout from OSU weighs 187 pounds and has&nbsp;9 1/2" hands.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Get to Know</strong></a> your favorite celebrities and <a href=#><strong>Explore</strong></a> relationship details of <a href=#><strong>NFL</strong></a> stars with <a href=#><strong>Celebs In-depth</strong></a>.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-170 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGiaoaqZqHqwuMCvnGafmae5p77InqWdZZ6buW6vzqaZoqaVYryptc5maWlqYmQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./cheryl-cole-net-worth-revealed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Cheryl's net worth?
