They were like, 'What are you...?' because we were all bringing in songs for this record we were going to make and they looked at me like I was crazy.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"And I’m like, 'Dude, this song really means a lot to me.' [And they said] 'So, dude, that’s not an REO Speedwagon song.' And I kind of was like, 'You know what? I’m the main songwriter for REO Speedwagon, so if I write a song, it’s an REO Speedwagon song. It’s the band's job to turn it into an REO Speedwagon song.'</p><p class=paragraph-text>"I was so passionate about this song.
