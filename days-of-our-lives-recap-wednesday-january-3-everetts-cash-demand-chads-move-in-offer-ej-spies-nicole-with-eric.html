Chad mulled over the idea for a moment and eventually accepted, so Julie was thrilled.</p><p>On The Bistro’s loading dock, EJ DiMera (Dan Feuerriegel) blamed Stefan DiMera (Brandon Barash) for helping Clyde Weston (James Read) move opioid-laced drugs and causing Holly’s ordeal.</p><p>Stefan argued that he was only trying to protect Gabi DiMera (last played by Camila Banus) and that if anyone was to blame, it was EJ for refusing to help him get rid of Clyde.</p><p>On Wednesday’s Days episode, EJ said to give him one good reason why he shouldn’t have Stefan arrested.</p><p>Stefan insisted that he’d implicate EJ if he did – and it wouldn’t be a stretch for anyone to believe since EJ was previously involved in the drug business with Clyde.</p><p>However, Stefan admitted that his heart broke for Holly, Nicole and EJ.</p><p>Although Stefan tried to act like they were on the same side, EJ didn’t think Stefan was being sincere and continued to bicker with him.</p><p>Although Everett seemingly didn’t overhear anything too incriminating, he did interrupt EJ and Stefan’s conversation.</p><p>Everett tried to ask some questions, but EJ refused to answer any and left.</p><p>As for Stefan on Wednesday’s DOOL show, he was careful to avoid blame in his own statement to Everett – though he did mention that he was adding an extra security detail and that his heart went out to Holly.</p><p>Everett seemed suspicious as he questioned Stefan and listened to his careful answers.</p><p>At home, Eric Brady (Greg Vaughan) was with Sloan Petersen-Brady (Jessica Seraty) and Jude Brady when he got a terrible phone call.</p><p>Marlena Evans (Deidre Hall) offered updates on Holly’s overdose, so Eric told Sloan that he had to get to the hospital.</p><p>Once Eric was gone, Sloan got an alert and complained about Leo Stark’s (Greg Rikaart) attempt to buy a $1,200 bottle of Champagne.</p><p>Sloan told Jude they were going on a field trip, which led to her showing up at the door of Leo’s suite and insisting all this crazy spending had to stop.</p><p>After Sloan sent Leo a financial fitness app, she insisted SHE would decide his monthly stipend and that he’d have to make it last.</p><p>Leo wasn’t happy about his new budget, but he struck a deal with Sloan since they’d both lose if she went broke or raised too many suspicions for Eric.</p><p>At the hospital on Wednesday’s Days episode, Nicole blamed herself for not seeing the warning signs with Holly, but Marlena tried to comfort her.</p><p>Next, Eric found Nicole and prayed with her at Holly’s bedside, but Holly suddenly had a seizure that left them both panicking.</p><p>Kayla Johnson (Mary Beth Evans) gave Holly an injection and stabilized her before reassuring Nicole that it was a pretty normal complication.</p><p>Marlena eventually spotted Eric embracing Nicole and heard about Holly’s seizure, so she was relieved that Kayla was able to handle things.</p><p>Later, EJ also showed up to find Nicole hugging Eric, so he glared at the exes as they shared a close moment.</p><p>Days of Our Lives spoilers say Eric and Nicole’s connection will lead to issues in Nicole’s marriage soon, so stay tuned.</p><p>CDL’s where you want to be for fantastic <a href=# rel=noopener>Days of Our Lives spoilers, updates and news, so make us your one-stop DOOL source.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaW1nlJbGtHnOn2SoraJiuarCxKxkq52Tlr1uw8SdpZ6rlJbGbrbAp6yaqqligG6x1Z6pnqykqHqkrdKhZJ2dnZa7pXnCoZidq12ivLexjKKlZqeWm7KzecSjZKyomZrAbrrInKalnV2strW0jJ6poptf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./latarence-dunbar.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="LaTarence Dunbar">&larr;
