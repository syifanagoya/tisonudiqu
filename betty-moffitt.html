Also, she helped her children to learn piano lessons, playing tennis and doing home works.</p><h2>How was Betty Moffitt's Married Life with Her Husband, Bill Moffitt?</h2><p>Betty Jerman Moffitt had a great bond with her husband, <strong>Bill Moffitt </strong>throughout their 65 years of marriage. They walked down the aisle in a Christian traditional wedding ceremony in <i>1941</i>.</p><p>Betty's late husband, Bill played basketball during his college days at Long Beach City College. Following graduation, he served U.S. Marine Navy during the World War II. He then rescued many people from burning houses as a firefighter of Long Beach Fire Department&nbsp;for overall <i>35 </i>years.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/7/19/169851491_1902467106583542_1379806059041397830_n%20(1)-1626681479077.jpg><p>The couple found the bundle of joys after becoming parents of Billie Jean King (born on <i>22nd November 1943</i>) and Randy Moffitt (born on <i>13th October 1948</i>). They raised their two children in their Long Beach, California house until they fully grown up.</p><p>Unfortunately, the pair's marriage ended after 65 years following the death of Bill on <i>16th June 2006</i> at their house in Prescott, Arizona. The Moffitt family held a memorial service for him at Hospice Family Care Center in Sheldon Street, Prescott.</p><h2>Died Due to Health Failure</h2><p>Billie Jean Moffitt's mother, Betty died at the age of <i>91 </i>due to some several health issues. She took her last breathe at her house based in Prescott, Arizona on <i>7th February 2014</i>. Similarly, an American businessperson, <a href=#><strong>Barron Hilton</strong></a> also passed away when he was <i>91 years old</i>.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>The Washington Times</i></a><i>,</i> Betty was survived by her children, Billie and Randy. During the deep distress, her daughter did not go to the Sochi Olympics opening ceremony because of her mother's demise.</p><h2>Betty Moffitt's Daughter, Billie's Earning & Net Worth!</h2><p>Randy Moffitt's mother, Betty won 16 grand games in women's doubles, 11 in mixed doubles, and 12 single games throughout her professional career.

The current value of her official website, billiejeanking.com is worth <strong>$7,200</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>At the moment, Billie owned a Malibu beach house for <strong>$500,000</strong>. As of <i>2021</i>, she maintains a decent net worth of <strong>$20 Million</strong>, which is far lesser than the total net value of late <a href=#><strong>Hugh Hefner</strong></a>.</p><h2>Betty Moffitt's Daughter, Billie Jean's Unfaithful Marriage with Larry King</h2><p>Betty Moffitt's daughter, Billie previously tied the knot to<strong> Larry King </strong>on <i>17th September 1965</i> in Long Beach, California. Prior to their marriage, they dated for two years after their first meeting at the California State University, Los Angeles in <i>1963</i>.</p><p>Following the nuptial, Billie confessed that she "was totally in love with Larry". However, it was found that she is having a bisexual relationship with King's secretary, <strong>Marilyn Barnett</strong> (born on <i>January 28, 1948</i>) in <i>1968</i>.</p><p>At that time, Marilyn was living rent-free in Billie and Larry King's house based in Malibu. After the affair came out, King asked her to leave the house in <i>1979.</i> But, she refused to leave and threatened to release credit card receipts, household bills and personal letter of Billie and Larry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/7/19/billie-jean-king-husband%20(1)-1626682150700.jpg><p>When things get out of control, Barnett filed a palimony lawsuit of <strong>$2 Million</strong>&nbsp;against Billie in <i>1981. </i>Nevertheless, the court did not fulfill Barnett's lawsuit&nbsp;appeal after finding some evidence of blackmailing and extortion.&nbsp;</p><p>Later, Billie admitted her affair with Barnett was a fling or mistake that will never happen again. She also revealed that she had an abortion of her and King's unborn child in <i>1971</i> without taking any advice or permission of her husband.</p><p>In a bizarre twist of fate, the couple stayed married until Billie did infidelity again with her extra-marital partner, <strong>Ilana Kloss </strong>in <i>1987</i>. Nonetheless, Billie took Kings' son, <strong>Sky</strong> <strong>King</strong> (from Kings' second marriage with <strong>Nancy King</strong>) under her wings as a godmother.</p><p>Following the divorce, Billie re-married her former tennis doubles partner, Ilana<strong> </strong>in a low-key wedding ceremony.
