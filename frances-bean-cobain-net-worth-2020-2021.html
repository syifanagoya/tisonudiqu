If you do not know, We have prepared this article about details of Frances Bean Cobain’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>Born on August 18, 1992, in Los Angeles, California, she was named after the guitarist of the Scottish indie-pop duo, The Vaselines, Frances McKee. Her father, Kurt, gave her the middle name Bean because he felt she looked like a kidney bean in an ultrasound.</p><p>At the time of her birth, the rumor mill was churning with news that her mother, Love, took heroin during her pregnancy. A lot of investigations took place and eventually absolved both parents of the blame. However, there were legal repercussions in that she was temporarily taken away from her parent’s care for two weeks.</p><p>The last time Cobain saw her father alive was in 1994 when she visited him in rehab. He was found dead soon after her visit.</p><p>She was raised by her mother, her aunts, and her paternal grandmother. She grew up in L.A. and Seattle. Her grandmother was given custody of her when her mother overdosed on painkillers. Love regained custody in 2005.</p><p>In 2010, when she inherited a major part of her father’s estate, it was revealed that she controls the publicity rights to Kurt Cobain’s name. In 2011, she bought a $1.8 million villa in West Hollywood.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>On June 29, 2014, Frances and fellow musician Isaiah Silva got married, but reports have confirmed that they divorced soon after, in November 2017.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 18 August 1992, Frances Bean Cobain is 31 years old as of today’s date 20th July 2024. Her height is 1.6 m tall, and her weight is 55 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>In 2006, she appeared in Elle magazine, dressed in her father’s cardigan and sweatpants as part of the magazine’s feature of children of rock stars dressed in their parent’s clothes. Bean featured in Harper’s Bazar and also modeled for a web photo series. She is also the face of Marc Jacob’s Spring/Summer 2017 campaign.</p><p>Her collection of artwork titled “Scumfuck” debuted in a gallery in L.A. in 2010.</p><p>Frances also made an appearance as a guest vocalist in the song “My Space” in the album Evelyn Evelyn. It is reported that she rejected the role of Alice in Alice in Wonderland, delaying her venture into acting.</p><p>Cobain was one of the executive producers in the HBO movie about her father’s life, titled, “Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck.”</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>The documentary that she helped produce on her father, “Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck,” received a Primetime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special in 2015.</p><p>Frances was also an intern for Rolling Stone magazine in 2008.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Frances Bean Cobain in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Frances-Bean-Cobain-Net-Worth.jpg><p>As of July 2024, Frances Bean Cobain’s net worth is a staggering $225 million. Unarguably most of her wealth comes from her father’s estate due to the enormous popularity of Nirvana even in the present day.</p><p>Quite surprisingly, it is Cobain’s daughter and not his wife, who holds the reins in terms of controlling publicity matters related to him.</p><p>Her earnings also stem from her own ad campaigns.</p><p>Undoubtedly, Cobain had a troubling childhood due to the nature of her parentage and the controversy surrounding their lives. In spite of that, she has matured into a strong woman. She reportedly reminds the members of Nirvana of her father. Even though her father’s grunge music is not to her taste, she recognizes its significance. She is also strongly defensive of her mother, who has been attacked on occasion by the media. Frances Bean Cobain shows promise, and the world hopes to see more of her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHApauhsaCav7S7zaxlnKedZLOzrc2cnKxlkpqur3nCqJmaoZ5iu6bAjLCmq6yYYn9xfo9maWlqYWQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-kiri-the-child-of-eywa-in-avatar-the-way-of-water.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Kiri the Child of Eywa in Avatar: The Way of Water?">&larr;
