Kasher had a difficult childhood, in his autobiography.&nbsp;</span><span>Kasher in the Rye: the true story of a white boy from Oakland who became a drug addict, criminal, mentally ill, and later turned 16</span><span>, he talks about the challenges faced with admissions to mental institutions from the age of 4, problems with his academics and battles with drugs from age 12 to 16.&nbsp;Kasher’s parents separated when he was 9, and at 17 he became a sign language interpreter.</span></p><p><span>After earning his GE at age 16, he attended community college in the Bay Area where he studied acting.&nbsp;He then transferred to the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he earned a degree in religious studies and a master’s degree in Jewish science.</span></p><p><span>Kasher was raised Jewish, his brother is a rabbi and before getting into acting he had considered teaching Jewish history as a college professor.</span></p><p><span>In 2001 he joined an old friend, Chelsea Peretti, and after a while Peretti brought Kasher to his first performance, an open mic at the Luggage Store Gallery in San Francisco.</span></p><p><span>In the early 2000s, Kasher performed in the Bay Zone primarily.&nbsp;He performed regularly at Cobb’s and Punch Line comedy clubs.&nbsp;He moved to Los Angeles in 2008. A year later, Kasher was named “Best of Fest” at the Aspen Rooftop Comedy Festival that year.</span></p><p><span>He then followed that up with an appearance on Comedy Central and an invite to the Just For Laughs comedy festival.&nbsp;A comedy album was released by Kasher in April 2009 and performed well, making it into the top 20 comedy albums on iTunes.&nbsp;His stand-up career has gone from strength to strength ever since.</span></p><p><strong><span>Also Read: Chris Distefano Wife, Girlfriend, Age, Daughter, Comedian Facts</span></strong></p><p><span>In addition to stand-up comedy, Kasher is a published writer with works like his autobiography and long monologue “Look Before You Leap” written in middle school, both already in print.&nbsp;Kasher also incorporated new spheres into his career and also ventured into acting.</span></p><p><span>He had roles in independent films like&nbsp;</span><span>West Hollywood’s Wish Makers</span><span>&nbsp;filmed in 2010 and&nbsp;</span><span>Sorry, Thank You</span><span>&nbsp;(2009).&nbsp;He also appeared on episodes of TV shows like&nbsp;</span><span>Shameless</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span>Traffic</span><span>&nbsp;Light, and&nbsp;</span><span>Whitney</span><span>.&nbsp;Kasher has also taken advantage of the digital age with various podcasts of which he is a part.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>Comedy is a profitable way to make a living if played right and so it’s proven for Mosher Kasher.&nbsp;Kasher’s net worth is estimated to be around $15 million.&nbsp;His career continued to progress.</span></p><h2><strong><span>women</span></strong></h2><p><span>Natasha Leggero is an American comedian, writer, and actress currently married to Moshe Kasher.&nbsp;She was born on March 26, 1974 in Rockford, Illinois.&nbsp;She is of Italian and Swedish ancestry, with a pinch of 6% sub-Saharan African ancestry (as revealed by a DNA test).&nbsp;Her rise to fame stemmed from her role as host of MTV’s The 70s House in 2005, as well as her tenure as a panelist on Chelsea Lately, Chelsea Handler’s late-night talk show.</span></p><p><span>Prior to his time with Moshe Kasher, Leggero had dated comedian Duncan Trussell between 2011 and 2012. The pair had co-hosted the podcast, The Lavender Hour.&nbsp;Kasher and Leggero tied the knot in 2015 and in an October 2017 interview with Stephen Colbert, she revealed that she and Kasher were expecting a baby.&nbsp;On February 24, 2018, Leggero via Instagram announced the birth of their first child, a baby girl.</span></p><h2><strong><span>the size</span></strong></h2><p><span>Moshe is not the greatest of men.&nbsp;Kosher stands at a small height of 5 feet 1 inch.&nbsp;Details of his other body stats are not available at this time.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is he gay?</span></strong></h2><p><span>He’s not gay.&nbsp;You could be forgiven if you thought that way when l</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiln6i1pnnKmqqhnaJixKqyxGafnqGXncFurcaeZKedpGLEsL7ToWSiq12dsm6zwLJm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./firefly-lane-filming-locations.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where is The Netflix Series Filmed?
